bio:
  - Hello! My name is Jillian Davies. I’m a recent graduate from St. Francis
    Xavier University where I earned a Bachelor of Science in Biology. I’m
    currently working in the McNichol Lab on a collaborative project with NRC
    colleagues and Dr. Tammy Rodela. Our research focuses on investigating the
    effects of microplastics on the gut microbiome of zebrafish. This experience
    has sparked an interest in host-microbe interactions and I plan to pursue a
    Master’s degree to explore this area further. Outside the lab I enjoy
    spending time outdoors watching movies and working on DIY projects.
