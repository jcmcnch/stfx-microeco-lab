Hello! My name is Julia Crean, and I am going into my fourth year of the Climate and Environment program at StFX! This summer, I am working in the StFX Microbial Ecology Lab as well as in the Canadian Carbon and Water Research lab. My project aims to discover the microbial communities that are involved with methane fluxes from the Quince Bog in Sherbrooke, Nova Scotia. A better understanding of these microbe functions will help us predict influences on future methane fluxes.
