Are you interested in studying the "unseen majority" of microbes in natural ecosystems / microbiomes? The lab will offically open in July 2023 and we may have some positions open for student research depending on funding. Contact Dr. McNichol with your CV, research interests, and desired type of position (i.e. undergraduate summer research project, honours thesis, graduate position, postdoc, volunteer, etc.) if you are interested to learn more about how we might work together. If this is your first time emailing someone to obtain research experience, I suggest looking online for advice. [This article](https://www.science.org/content/article/dear-dr-neufeld) is a good place to start!
