Are you interested in studying the "unseen majority" of microbes in natural ecosystems / microbiomes? There are many opportunities for student research projects in this broad and interdisciplinary field! Students who are in related fields such as Earth Science, Geology, Computer Science, Engineering, etc should feel comfortable contacting me (i.e. not just Biology majors!). To discuss further you can do one of two things. a) drop by my office to discuss informally (JBB 419) or b) contact me by email with your CV / résumé, research interests, and desired type of position (i.e. undergraduate summer research project, honours thesis, graduate position, postdoc, volunteer, etc.). If this is your first time emailing someone to obtain research experience, I suggest looking online for advice. [This article](https://www.science.org/content/article/dear-dr-neufeld) is a good place to start!
