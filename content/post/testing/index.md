Hi everyone,

This website will be where you can get information on a new microbe-focused research group to be established in StFX's biology department in July 2023. It is still under active construction, but already gives some general information about the type of research areas that will be pursued. If you're interested to learn more you can drop me an email or come visit in person in July 2023!

Jesse
