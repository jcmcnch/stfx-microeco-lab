The StFX Microbial Ecology Lab studies the interactions between microbes (*Bacteria*, *Archaea*, and *Eukarya*), their physical environment, and the biosphere as a whole. We use a combination of field work, modern DNA sequencing, and classical microbiological approaches to address diverse research questions. Click on "Tour" at the top to see some examples of research topics or scroll down to see the latest news from the group.
